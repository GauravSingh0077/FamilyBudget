# FamilyBudget

The program is built in Python and can be run like any Python file.

Four users are already created.

Budgets are in form of list with first entry as index, second as income, third as expense. For example a budget of [4, 5600,340] has 4 as its index, 5600 as income and 340 as expense.

After selecting a user it has 4 options of showing all the user budgets, showing all the shared budgets, adding another budget or sharing budget with another user.

A user's information can be seen by selecting a user.

While sharing a budget, the budget is to be selected by its index. For example if budget [3, 2400, 342] appears it can be selected by entering 3.
